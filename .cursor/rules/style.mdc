## UI Style Guidelines

### PrimeVue

- Prefer to use PrimeVue compontents where possible
- A custom PrimeVue theme is configured with dark mode as default, handling most color-related styles for us.

### General Theme

- Dark Mode is default — all UI elements follow a dark, low-contrast background with light text for high readability.
- For text / background colors, prefer to use `...-surface-...` f.e. `border-surface-700`.
- Caido uses `bg-surface-800` as the main app background, `bg-surface-700` is the background used for `Card` component.
- Follow minimalistic color palette. AVOID using too much colors where possible.

### Layout & Components

- Often use PrimeVue `Splitter` and `SplitterPanel` for vertical or horizontal layout.
- Prefer to use `Card` PrimeVue components a lot, if needed add `h-full` to them via `pt` params.

Example:

```
<Card
  class="h-full"
  :pt="{
    body: { class: 'h-full p-0' },
    content: { class: 'h-full flex flex-col' },
  }"
>
```

### Enviroment

- Keep in mind that we are building a plugin that's inside a Caido web app, we can modify frontend by adding sidebar pages using Caido Frontend SDK.
- Our plugin content is rendered within a dedicated window/panel that Caido provides for our sidebar page.
- The plugin UI should integrate seamlessly with Caido's existing interface and theming.

### Data Representation

- Prefer `DataTable` component for displaying structured data:
  * Caido often uses `stripedRows`, use it where possible
  * Actions column at the end (e.g. “Install” buttons).
- Empty states use friendly, minimal messages with icons.

### Icons

- Always use `fas fa-[...]` for icons. We don't support any other icon libraries.
